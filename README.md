# LuxAdr Service
 LuxAdr provides a state of the art API to access data related to all official addresses of Luxembourg. 
 The data structure is closely related to the official data provided by data.public.lu and can be kept up 
 to date with ease. Among others you will have access to all:

- Localities
- Postcodes
- Streets
- House numbers (Buildings)
- Location data of the buildings (latitude, longitude)

Several search features are included and designed to be used, among others, from web pages. 
You will also have the possibility to search via location data. Additionally once imported, data will never be deleted, 
only deactivated, so if you make a reference to an id it will be always be available for later use.
